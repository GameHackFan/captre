# Captain Commando Readjusted
A mod for the Captain Commando (World, Arcade).
<br/>
This mod brings some extra features and changes to the original game.
<br/><br/>
You can access the patcher [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/captre/).
<br/><br/>

Version 1.1:
- Fixed a bug in the color conflict code.
- Doppel now selects his targets like a conventional enemy, ignoring the twin targeting (it was buggy if players had the same character, the new targeting also makes him harder).
- Improved the way the game interprets the execution of Jump + Punch (you can hold Jump and press Punch).
- Added a player character randomizer, select pressing the start button and the character will change for every new area.
- Added 4 new colors for all playable characters, it now has original + 7 colors (8 colors).

See all changes made [here](https://github.com/GameHackFan/captre/blob/main/changelog).
<br/><br/>

Known Bugs:
- Doppel, when he transforms for the second time, it is possible to hold some of his replicas, not allowing them to transform, which will lead to him spawning more replicas then he should (have no clue if it can be done in the original game, but it can in the readjusted version).
- On 5th Stage, P1, P2 and P3 can jump on the platform behind them, making their character float
(bug present in the original game).
- On 4th Stage, if you get to the boss with the Green Robot, the player with the robot can grab the monster while another player punch him to death, he doesn't even move (bug present in the original game).
- If you reach a boss right after the time expires, you don't lose your life, you can defeat the boss with the time label on the screen and nothing happens (bug present in the original game).
- If you let the time expire and you do not let your character to go back to the idle action, for example you keep punching or jumping forever, it will display a time over label but the game will not be able to kill you until you fail to keep punching or jumping, you can even beat the entire stage like that (bug present in the original game).

WHAT'S NEXT: The only interesting thing to do is make 4 players mode behave like 2 and 3 players mode do, add the rest of the dipswitches settings to the configuration menu, make the robots discharge faster and take less damage, redrawn the other shock sprites to use pallete C, and also maybe create the ice cube animations for all the enemies, but I have no idea if I will do those things.
